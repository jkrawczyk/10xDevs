# Supabase Auth Integration

Use this guide to introduce authentication (sign-up & sign-in) in Astro applications with server-side rendering (SSR) support

## Before we start

VERY IMPORTANT: Ask me which pages or components should behave differently after introducing authentication. Adjust further steps accordingly.

## Core Requirements

1. Use `@supabase/ssr` package (NOT auth-helpers) through already prepared `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` on client side and `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` on server side and `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
2. Use ONLY `getAll` and `setAll` for cookie management
3. NEVER use individual `get`, `set`, or `remove` cookie methods
4. Implement proper session management with middleware based on JWT (Supabase Auth)

## Installation

```bash
npm install @supabase/ssr @supabase/supabase-js
```

## Security Best Practices

- Set proper cookie options (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Never expose Supabase integration & keys in client-side components
- Validate all user input server-side
- Use proper error handling and logging

## Common Pitfalls

1. DO NOT use individual cookie methods (get/set/remove)
2. DO NOT import from @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
3. DO NOT skip the auth.getUser() call in middleware
4. DO NOT modify cookie handling logic
5. Always handle auth state changes properly
